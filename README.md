# Deep Learning Exercises

This is a set of exercises about Deep Learning. These exercises will help you better familiarize with PyTorch and building models of fully connected networks, CNN, graph neural netowrks, attention mechanism and reinforcement learning.

The level of difficulty goes from 1 to 7 (1 being the easiest, 7 the hardest):

<ul>
  <li>Homework 1: FC network (1)</li>
  <li>Homework 2: CNN for classification (2) and image reconstruction (4)</li>
  <li>Homework 3: Graph neural network for classification (5) and for path prediction (6)</li>
  <li>Homework 4: Graph neural network with slot attention mechanism (7)</li>
  <li>Homework 5: Reinforcement learning to play the game of Pong (3)</li>
</ul>
